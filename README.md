# colour-sensor
in this cod what  iam doing is that first turning on red led then blue then green and checking the  intensity of light reflected by the object 
the intensity oflight reflected by the object  in lets say red color relative to the intensity of light eflected by white object gives us how much red is the object and repectively for other colors.
i manually entered the values for white object and then set threshold above which it takes the color into account or not
due to network issues havent uploaded video yet will do soon
